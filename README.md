## Tips and Tricks

### Money/Cash
- Before you leave the States, you should convert some USD to JPY (Japanese Yen), because the conversion rate is probably best here. If you're tight on time before departure, your second best option is at the airport. As soon as you touch down, along with getting your eSIM/Pocket WiFi, try to find one of the cash exchange booths. Don't worry, they won't try to scam you. I've always gotten a pretty good rate.
- Definitely carry at least **8,000 ~ 10,000 yen** with you at all times. In non-urban areas, carry **10,000 ~ 20,000 yen.** Top up as needed. 
- Don’t be afraid to take cash from **ATMs in 7-11.** I was put off initially by the **3.5% transaction fee**, but the conversion rate from your Chase/BofA more than makes up for it.
- Google exchange rates for yen and don't accept more than **3.5 to 4%** difference in what Google says. Some places tried to sell us yen for 15% less.

### Phone
- If you can't get international service with your carrier, you need to buy some form of data to travel well in Japan. This is because you're probably going to be relying on Google Maps, Safari, and Tabelog pretty heavily for navigation.
  
#### Options:
1. **If traveling with a party:** Buy a **pocket Wi-Fi device** at the airport. 
2. **If traveling alone:** An **eSIM** might be best.

- At Narita (NRT) and Haneda (HND) airports, you should be able to find stands with English-speaking clerks ready to help you.
- If you anticipate that your trip will be jam-packed, you might not want to worry about charging and bringing around an extra device.

**Recommendation:** I personally went with the company [Mobal](https://www.mobal.com) for both eSIMs and Pocket WiFi. You can order in advance and pick up your order upon arrival.

### Download: Suica
- You gotta get around in Japan easily and conveniently. You may have heard of “IC” cards. These are their transportation cards, and most metropolitan areas have their own version. 
- The simplest and easiest way to get a card is to add it to your **Apple Wallet!**
  - Getting a physical one at a machine in Japan could be worth it if you want some memorabilia, but with recent chip shortages and the inconvenience of sifting through menus, I always recommend just getting it in your Apple Wallet.
  - Before you leave, make sure your entire party adds the “Suica” app on their Apple Wallet.

#### Steps:
1. Open Wallet App.
2. Add Card: Tap the “+” button to add a card.
3. Select Suica: Choose “Suica” from the list of options.
4. Link or Create an Account: Proceed with creating a new card.
   - If you have a physical one, you can link it here.
5. Go through setup.
6. Add funds.

### Download: Tabelog
- Maybe you want to treat your parents out to something fancy or you just want the best cost-performance food, “Tabelog” is your best friend.
- It’s basically the Yelp of Japan with far more critical reviews (you’d be hard-pressed to find a restaurant with more than 4 stars!)
- They have an app, but because we are not residents of Japan, it is not available to us.
- Regardless, you can use the web version on your computer or iPhone.

#### To find the best of the best:
1. Search **”百貨店” (Hyakkaten):** This returns a list of restaurants that have won this award in Japan.  
   - This is the **Michelin Star of Japan.**
   - They’re not always expensive!
2. Use the web version to sort by reviews; this works well too.

### Accommodation Considerations
#### Why focus on this?
- Most of the time, people spend way too much on accommodations.
- But sometimes, you don't want to skimp out on "experiencing Japan."
- Below is the combo I use for maximum "bang-for-buck."

#### Budget: Airbnb
**Pros:**
- Usually cheaper than business hotels.  
- Provides a sense of living in Japan (Japanese appliances, tatami mats).  
- Hosts can give local recommendations.  
- Usually equipped with washers, dryers, and kitchens.

**Cons:**
- Slightly less convenient locations.  
- Restricted check-in times can be annoying.  

#### Hotels
**Pros:**
- Familiar setup, with English-speaking staff.  
- Central locations.  
- 24-hour check-in and baggage drop.

**Cons:**
- Often more expensive.  
- Lacks the authentic Japanese living experience.  

#### Ryokan (Traditional Japanese Inns)
- Japanese-style inns that offer the **ultimate traditional Japanese experience.**  
- Found in hot spring towns and often include:  
  - Tatami rooms, futon beds, Japanese baths, local cuisine.  
  - Meals (kaiseki dinner and breakfast) are included in the price.

**Cost:** ¥15,000 ~ ¥25,000 per person, per night.  
**Recommended Locations:**  
- Atami, Beppu, Ishikawa, Kanazawa, Nikko, Kinosaki, Hakone.  
**Tony’s Picks:**  
- Hakone Prince Yunohana Hotel.  
- Hakone Yumoto Onsen Tenseien.

## Food

### General Recommendations
- To be honest, I liked **everything** I ate in Japan. Maybe I don't have a sophisticated palate, or maybe food in Japan is just that good. Tabelog will probably give you much better recommendations than I will, but I have a couple of general suggestions.
- **Note:** From what I noticed when I ate out with Japanese friends, the local **¥1,000–¥1,500 ($8–$10)** restaurant is often better than the top-ranked **¥5,000–¥50,000 ($30–$300)** spot on Tabelog, all things considered.

**Traveling with family?**  
- Only go to a semi-nice place once every couple of days.  
- In between, try:
  - **Family restaurants:** Denny's, Saizeriya, Moss Burger.  
  - **Fast Gyudon Beef Bowl chains:** Sukiya, Matsuya, Yoshinoya.  
  - **Dine-and-dip ramen shops:** Affordable, quick, and delicious.

## Travel

### JR Pass
- You might have heard about the JR Pass and even been recommended to buy it.  
- **However:** With the recent spike in price, you'd need to meticulously plan your itinerary and pack events closely to make it worthwhile.  
- Instead, I recommend buying tickets as needed online.  

### Best Option to Get to Kyoto/Osaka and Back
- **Overnight bus:**  
  - Affordable and great for budget travelers.  
  - Round-trip Shinkansen (bullet train) is **$100–$150 more expensive.**  
  - Shinkansen is only worth it for the experience or if you're very short on time.
